Console application on C++ which enables writing, editing, loading, reading from txt.  

# üéØ Supported commands
1. **Append** - appends to the end of the file
2. **Newline** - starts a newline at current cursor position
3. **Save to a txt file**
4. **Load from a txt file**
5. **Print current text** to the screen
6. **Insert** substring at current cursor position
7. **Insert & Replace** at current cursor position 
8. **Search for a substring** and output where it occurs
9. **Set Cursor Position** - sets cursor at specified row column 
10. **Delete specified number of symbols** from current cursor position
11. **Cut/Copy/Paste** (if buffer is empty it pastes an empty str)
12. **Cipher txt** enables you to Encrypt/Decrypt an existing `.txt` 
    
# üìÅ Repo structure and source files
1. `Buffer.h` features the functionality of buffer which powers the program, it is dependent on `Cursor` inner class and `Common.h`.
2. `Cursor` simple class for managing an object which has `size_t` `Row` and `Column` fields.
3. `Common.h` is a header file with functions which are not clasified to direct functionality, but still important.
4. `TextEditor.h` is a header which features the `TextEditor` class the main idea of which is to encapsulate the process of handling the user input calling corresponding functions from `Buffer.h`, `CaesarCipher.h`, etc.
5. `CaesarCipher.h` is a header file which has a clss which is responsible for Encrypting and Decrypting logic by cominicating with `CaesarDLL`.  
6. `Source.cpp` is a main file, it gets the command from user, and passes on the execution to headers files.
7. `CaesarDLL` is a DLL project which has the Encryption functions.
